# TotalJS - Typescript: Examples

------------------

This Repository contains some Examples copied from the offical example-repository of total.js 
[https://github.com/totaljs/examples]

It has been created to show possible use of the totaljs framework with typescript.

## Setup Examples

To safely setup the examples run in all example directory the **npm install** command.

### tsd

All examples need tsd to get the latest typescript definitions. I recomend installing tsd globaly **npm install tsd -g**.
But running **npm install** would also be enough.

### total.js

All examples use total.js. 

Install total.js globaly with **npm install -g total.js** this recomeded by the original creator of the example repository. 

Or run in every example **npm install**, mostly you are required to run this command anyway.

## Documentation & Framework

You will find more informations about the total.js framework and the documentation on the offical webpage [http://www.totaljs.com/]
